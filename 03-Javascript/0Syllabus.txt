Comparison operators: ==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=
Logical operators: &&, ||, !
Ternary operator (condition ? expr1 : expr2)
Bitwise operators
Spread/rest operators (...)
Destructuring assignment

4. Control Flow
Conditional statements: if, else, else if, switch
Loops: for, while, do...while
Loop control: break, continue, return
forEach loop
Exception handling: try, catch, finally, throw

Object.freeze() and Object.seal()

7. Arrays
Creating arrays and accessing elements
Array methods: .push(), .pop(), .shift(), .unshift()
Array iteration: .forEach(), .map(), .filter(), .reduce()
Array sorting: .sort(), .reverse()
Array manipulation: .concat(), .slice(), .splice()
Multidimensional arrays
Destructuring arrays

8. Asynchronous JavaScript
Callbacks and callback functions
Promises: creating, consuming, chaining, error handling
async and await
Error handling with promises (.catch(), try/catch)

setTimeout() and setInterval()

9. DOM Manipulation
Understanding the Document Object Model (DOM)
Selecting DOM elements: getElementById(), getElementsByClassName(), querySelector(), querySelectorAll()
Modifying DOM elements: innerHTML, textContent, setAttribute(), style
Creating, appending, and removing elements
Event handling: addEventListener()
Event propagation: bubbling, capturing, and delegation
Handling user inputs: form elements, validation
