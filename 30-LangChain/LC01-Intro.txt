what is the LangChain ?
LangChain is an open-source framework designed to help developers build applications 
powered by large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT, Anthropic's Claude, or Google's
 Gemini. It simplifies the process of integrating AI 
into applications by providing tools for:

LLM Wrappers – Easily connect to OpenAI, Hugging Face, or custom models.
Prompt Templates – Standardize and manage AI prompts dynamically.
Chains – Combine multiple LLM calls, API calls, or functions into workflows.
Memory – Maintain context across conversations (useful for chatbots).
Agents – Enable LLMs to decide which tools to use dynamically.
Data Loaders – Process PDFs, HTML, or databases for AI processing.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) – Enhance responses with real-time data from external sources.
