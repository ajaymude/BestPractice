Docker Compose Explained ðŸš€
What is Docker Compose?
Docker Compose is a tool used to define and manage multi-container applications using a YAML file (docker-compose.yml).
It simplifies running multiple services (e.g., Node.js + MongoDB) in a single command.
Works by defining services, networks, and volumes in one file.


Key Features of Docker Compose
Multi-container support â€“ Define multiple services in one file.
Simplifies networking â€“ Containers communicate using service names.
Easy volume and environment management.
One command to start all services (docker-compose up).







// basic docker compose YAML file 


version: "3.8"

services:
  app:
    image: node:18
    container_name: my-node-app
    working_dir: /app
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - db
    command: "node server.js"

  db:
    image: mongo
    container_name: my-mongodb
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    volumes:
      - mongo_data:/data/db

volumes:
  mongo_data:





















// all docker command 


# Check Docker Compose version
docker-compose --version

# Start all services (runs in foreground)
docker-compose up

# Start all services in detached mode (background)
docker-compose up -d

# Stop all running services
docker-compose down

# Stop and remove containers, networks, volumes
docker-compose down --volumes

# Restart all services
docker-compose restart

# List running containers managed by Docker Compose
docker-compose ps

# View logs of services
docker-compose logs -f

# Build images (if using build context in YAML)
docker-compose build

# Start a specific service
docker-compose up -d app

# Stop a specific service
docker-compose stop app

# Remove a specific service's container
docker-compose rm app

# Execute a command inside a running container
docker-compose exec app bash

# Scale services (e.g., run 3 instances of app)
docker-compose up -d --scale app=3
