// types of the docker network 

bridge → Default network, isolated from other networks.
host → Shares host's network (no isolation).
none → No network access.
overlay → Multi-host communication (Swarm).
macvlan → Acts like a physical device.
docker network ls → List networks.
docker network create → Create a new network.
docker network connect → Attach a container to a network.
docker network prune → Remove unused networks.





# List all Docker networks
docker network ls

# Create a new bridge network
docker network create my_bridge_network

# Create an overlay network (for Swarm mode)
docker network create -d overlay my_overlay_network

# Create a macvlan network
docker network create -d macvlan --subnet=192.168.1.0/24 -o parent=eth0 my_macvlan_network

# Inspect a specific network
docker network inspect my_bridge_network

docker network inspect bridge

# Connect a running container to a network
docker network connect my_bridge_network my-container

# Disconnect a container from a network
docker network disconnect my_bridge_network my-container

# Remove a specific network
docker network rm my_bridge_network

# Remove all unused networks
docker network prune



















Docker Volume: A Docker-managed storage method that persists data beyond container lifecycles, 
stored in /var/lib/docker/volumes/. It is ideal for sharing data between containers and ensuring data persistence.

Docker Storage: Refers to different methods (Volumes, Bind Mounts, tmpfs) used to manage data in Docker, 
affecting how data is stored, accessed, and shared between containers and the host system.
