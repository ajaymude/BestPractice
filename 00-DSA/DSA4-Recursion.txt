What is Recursion?
Recursion is a method where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. 
The key idea is that a problem can often be broken down into smaller, simpler versions of the same problem.



function factorial(n) {
  // Base Case: Factorial of 0 is 1
  if (n === 0) {
    return 1;
  }
  // Recursive Case: n * factorial of n-1
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

console.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120
