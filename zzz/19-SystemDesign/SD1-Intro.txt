// scaling 

/ 1 - horizontal scaling 
/ 2 - vertical scaling 


// single point of failure 


// database replication 
// sharding of the database 

// data lake - large data is know as the data lake 




// acid 

ACID compliance refers to a set of properties that ensure reliable database transactions. ACID stands for:

Atomicity ‚Äì Each transaction is either fully completed or fully rolled back. If one part of a transaction fails, the entire transaction fails.

Example: Transferring money between bank accounts‚Äîboth debit and credit operations must succeed together.



Consistency ‚Äì The database remains in a valid state before and after a transaction. Transactions cannot violate database constraints.

Example: If a database enforces a rule that prevents negative balances, a transaction reducing a balance below zero will be rejected.



Isolation ‚Äì Transactions are executed independently and do not interfere with each other.

Example: If two users try to book the last available seat in a movie theater simultaneously, only one transaction should succeed.



Durability ‚Äì Once a transaction is committed, it is permanently stored, even in the event of a system crash.

Example: After a successful order placement in an e-commerce app, the order should not disappear even if the server crashes.



Why is ACID Important?
Ensures data integrity and reliability.
Critical for financial applications, e-commerce, and enterprise systems where consistency is key.
ACID vs. NoSQL Databases
Relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) follow ACID strictly.
NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra) may sacrifice some ACID properties to achieve better scalability and performance.













// cap theorem 
CAP Theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance)
The CAP theorem, formulated by Eric Brewer, states that a distributed database can achieve only two out of three properties at any given time:

Consistency (C) ‚Äì Every read receives the most recent write or an error.

Example: If you update a user‚Äôs profile, any future read should reflect this change immediately.



Availability (A) ‚Äì Every request receives a response (success or failure), even if some nodes are down.

Example: If one database server goes down, another should still respond to queries.



Partition Tolerance (P) ‚Äì The system continues to work even when network failures (partitions) occur between nodes.

Example: If a server cluster is split due to a network failure, the database should still operate.



Trade-offs in CAP Theorem
Since you can pick only two out of three, databases are categorized as:



CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)

Ensures consistency but may sacrifice availability.
Example: MongoDB (when using replica sets with majority writes)
Use Case: Banking systems, financial transactions (where consistency is critical).



AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance)

Ensures high availability but may return stale data.
Example: Cassandra, DynamoDB, and MongoDB (eventual consistency mode)
Use Case: Social media feeds, caching systems (where availability matters more).



CA (Consistency + Availability)

Works only if there's no network partition, which is unrealistic in distributed systems.
Example: Single-node relational databases like MySQL
Use Case: Traditional monolithic applications (not distributed).
